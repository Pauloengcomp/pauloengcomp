# Paulo Lima

Data Engineer focused on building reliable, scalable and production-grade data systems.

I design end-to-end data pipelines with clear separation of concerns, layered architectures and automation-first workflows.

## Core Focus

• Orchestrated data pipelines with Apache Airflow  
• Layered architectures (RAW → SILVER → GOLD)  
• Incremental processing and stateful workflows  
• Data modeling and SQL optimization (PostgreSQL)  
• Business-rule driven transformation layers  
• Automated alerting and operational data workflows  
• Modular, testable and observable systems

## System Architecture Approach

Typical workflow I implement:

Data Source  
→ Orchestration Layer (Airflow)  
→ Raw ingestion  
→ Structured transformations  
→ Business logic layer  
→ Operational outputs (alerts, reports, downstream systems)

Design principles:

- Idempotent pipeline design  
- Retry-aware tasks and controlled failure handling  
- Logging and observability built-in  
- Clear separation between orchestration and transformation logic  
- Reproducible environments

## Engineering Stack

Python  
Apache Airflow  
PostgreSQL  
Docker  
Slack API (operational automation)  
Git

## Engineering Principles

- Reliability over novelty  
- Explicit data contracts  
- Deterministic transformations  
- Fail loudly, recover safely  
- Automate everything that can be automated

Open to data engineering roles focused on scalable systems, workflow automation and production-grade analytics infrastructure.
