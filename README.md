# Paulo Lima

Computer Engineer specialized in designing and implementing scalable, reliable and automated data pipelines.

I focus on building robust data architectures that transform raw datasets into structured, business-ready information through layered processing and orchestration workflows.

---

## 🔧 What I Build

- End-to-end ETL/ELT pipelines with Airflow  
- Layered data architectures (RAW → SILVER → GOLD)  
- Incremental data processing and state management  
- Automated business alerting systems (Slack integrations)  
- PostgreSQL data modeling and query optimization  
- Data validation and monitoring workflows  
- Modular and testable pipeline design  

---

## 🚀 Featured Architecture

Example of a production-style data workflow I implement:

Data Source  
→ Airflow Orchestration  
→ RAW Layer  
→ SILVER Transformation  
→ GOLD Business Logic Layer  
→ Alerting Service (Slack Bot)  

Key characteristics:

- Retry policies and failure handling  
- Structured logging  
- Separation of concerns (ETL, business logic, alerting)  
- Configurable execution  
- Automation-first mindset

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Orchestration:** Apache Airflow  
**Processing:** Python, Pandas  
**Database:** PostgreSQL  
**Automation:** Slack API  
**Containerization:** Docker  
**Version Control:** Git

## 📌 Engineering Principles

- Build for reliability before complexity  
- Keep pipelines modular and maintainable  
- Separate transformation logic from orchestration  
- Design for observability and controlled failure

I am interested in data engineering roles focused on scalable data systems, automation and production-grade data workflows.
